# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

This projects includes an analysis of a ride sharing app company using given data from the city as well as data about each rider.

## Project Results:

The below information shows the results of the findings from the analysis;

### Rides Count

* Urban cities have the highest number of rides followed by Suburban cities. Rural cities had the least amount of rides.
* The total rides count is 2,375.

### Drivers Count

* The Drive Count followed the same trend with Urban cities having the most, followed by Suburban cities and Rural having the least.
* The total drivers count is 2,973.

### Total Fares

* Fares followed suit with Urban in first, suburban in second and rural in third.
* Urban cities total = $39,854 fares.
* Suburban cities total = $19,356 fares.
* Rural cities total = $4,328 fares.
* Total overall fares = $63,538.

### Average Fare per ride/driver

* The average fares have shown the opposite pattern as has been previously experienced.
* Rural cities made the most per ride on average, followed by suburban while urban made the least.
* That trend carries over to drivers as well.

## Summary

There seems to be a few changes that can be made to increase profitability.

Firstly, the data shows there are many inactive drivers in the urban cities. It is possible to move them to suburban or rural cities where the average ride is more expensive. This would benefit the company as well as the drivers, as they would make more profits.

Secondly, by increasing the price of rides in urban cities, the company could potentially see massive increases in revenue.
